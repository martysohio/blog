      <description>Not a hard one: You are given an integer N. Can you find the least positive integer X made up of only 9&#39;s and 0&#39;s, such that, X is a multiple of N?
Any number consisting of just 9s and 0s is divisible by 9. I see a few ways to use that, also 9s and 0s are two unique characters, so another way would be to process numbers are strings matching those characters rather than evaluating every multiple of N until you hit one thats divisible by 9, as something can be divisible by 9 but not be only 9s and 0s.</description>

      <description>Burnout and You Having worked at the same company for 5+ years, its not impossible that at some point I&amp;rsquo;ve suffered from burnout. However, since I am working at the same place, it has not been enough to leave. I can say I have watched several people crash spectacularly. From watching them I&amp;rsquo;ve got some shitty unsolicited advice for anyone who has a cushy middle class job.
First, get your personal shit in order.</description>

      <title>Canadian Geese - Nature&#39;s Satanic Cult</title>

      <description>Geese are a scourge Since my wife and I are getting old, we&amp;rsquo;ve taken up gardening and with age comes us getting better at it. So of course this year I wanted to try the Three Sisters method of planting. I would plant corn, beans and squash together to maximize the output for a given area, and it would take a bit less work.
In the spirit of overdoing it, our neighbor was kind enough to use his big Kobota tractor with a tiller attachment to grind up a big area in our backyard.</description>

      <title>Our First Foster Placement Pt. 3 - The End</title>

      <description>Out the door Leading up to the first weekend away, we called and sent an email to the case worker. We wanted confirmation the children would be able to go to their Aunt&amp;rsquo;s for the weekend. Instead of confirmation (which we had gotten verbally), my wife got a bit of a dressing down over the phone (or at one of their schedule visits, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember which). Paraphrasing - the worker more or less said no one involved had the right to make those decisions except her/Cuyahoga county.</description>

      <description>On the way Despite the stress for everyone involved, we were aware our placements would be leaving us by summer, at least as of January. In February, we were summoned for what was called a staffing meeting. This is where various parties related to the case gather together and discuss things that could be in an email.
The meeting did not really concern us, though my wife and I were both present.</description>

      <description>Foster care sure was something On October 26th, we got a call about our first foster placement. In the month prior, we had taken a few weekend cases for respite care. Respite care is babysitting for other foster parents. Then they can take a break or take care of a few things. Leading into the proper placement, respite care went ok. It was a bit hard since the kids were so young and couldn&amp;rsquo;t bond with us over a weekend.</description>

      <description>This timeline is weird If you&amp;rsquo;d told me 15 years ago, I would have two kids and be fostering two more, I&amp;rsquo;d have called you nuts. I&amp;rsquo;ve turned into everyone&amp;rsquo;s dad. The stampede of footsteps every morning is my alarm clock. And my day is a constant stream of the question &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;.
Expectation never meets reality, and I&amp;rsquo;m not unhappy at all. People think you can make precarious plans and follow them.</description>
