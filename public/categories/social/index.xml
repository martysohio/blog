      <description>When I was kid, every year around Christmas, through middle school, everyone was excited about potential gifts. For my peer group, the prized possession was any kind of gaming console and games. I.e. SNES/Gensis games, then Playstation 1/N64 up through the Dreamcast across the 90s.
Other kids had other dreams. In retrospect, those dreams were very materialistic. We all wanted things. No one was asking for experience or something intangible. Even the elementary school atmosphere encouraged materialism as a form of affection.</description>
