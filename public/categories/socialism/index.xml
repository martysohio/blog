      <description>Socialism is a complicated topic and not the shallow term frequently employed by its critics. Since many people already put the effort in at Wikipedia, you can read all about Socialism there. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve read that, you should be convinced that socialism is not well defined.
Unfortunately, the lack of definition leaves socialism open for quick attacks from anyone in any circumstance. Rebuttals are difficult, only because most people on the attack against socialist policies tend to do so in bad faith.</description>
