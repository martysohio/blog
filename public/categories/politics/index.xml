      <description>Shamelessly stole a lot of the links here from a post on SA, but thats ok, its for a good cause. Joe Biden is easily the worst Democratic party candidate for President I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my lifetime. And the farthest I can remember back is Gore (but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t vote at the time). I expect he will be another portrait on the hall of shame, for innumerable reasons, come November. Gore was the worst loss, and should have been the canary in the coal mine for the party to start shifting.</description>
