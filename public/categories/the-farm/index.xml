      <description>Geese are a scourge Since my wife and I are getting old, we&amp;rsquo;ve taken up gardening and with age comes us getting better at it. So of course this year I wanted to try the Three Sisters method of planting. I would plant corn, beans and squash together to maximize the output for a given area, and it would take a bit less work.
In the spirit of overdoing it, our neighbor was kind enough to use his big Kobota tractor with a tiller attachment to grind up a big area in our backyard.</description>
