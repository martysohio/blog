      <description>In the search for more shows to binge, I finally got around to watching Jack Ryan. MORE LIKE JIM RYAN, RIGHT ? But anyway, I am not sure which side the writers want the viewers to take. Like every other entry Jack Ryan media, the central character is an upstart wonk. He sits in a corner doing his work until duty calls. Then he is thrust back into action and becomes John Rambo as needed.</description>
