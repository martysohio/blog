<h2 id="burnout-and-you">Burnout and You</h2>

<p>Having worked at the same company for 5+ years, its not impossible that at some point I&rsquo;ve suffered from burnout.  However, since I am working at the same place, it has not been enough to leave.  I can say I have watched several people crash spectacularly.  From watching them I&rsquo;ve got some shitty unsolicited advice for anyone who has a cushy middle class job.</p>

<p>First, get your personal shit in order.  Everyone has problems, sucks, but true.  It is very possible you are right, and your work sucks and everyone there is conspiring against you.  However, introspection is the best first step you can take.</p>

<p>Your personal shit may range from the simple, like making you are getting the right amount of sleep, diet, and exercise. To the complex, where you have various health issues (including mental health!) outside your immediate control.  Get help for any of it ! Find a workout buddy, get your significant other to join you in your quest to exercise and feel alive.  Or see a doctor (assuming you have health insurance, may not apply in America).</p>

<p>The point of introspection is not to shift blame away from your employer or work conditions.  Rather I think anyone should eliminate the other possibilities, first.  And you may not be able to control your work conditions so it is best to focus on what can be changed immediately, then work your way out.  Of course, some situations may be obviously untenable and clearly external.</p>

<p>Assuming your personal life is going great, start looking at your work environment.  What kind of problems are exhausting you -</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you bored ?</li>
<li>Do you feel stagnant in your current position ?</li>
<li>Is someone or something contributing to a toxic work environment ?</li>
<li>Is the work itself toil ?</li>
<li>Are changes within the company creating uncertainty for your future ?</li>
</ul>

<p>The general answer to concerns like the above is to talk to your management. If your direct manager is causing you a problem, there should be another above him or her you can talk to.  If that is frowned upon, leave because open door policies are important for resolving issues.  Alternatively, maybe you reached the top of the chain (CEO/owners) and then you take a risk with the discussion.</p>

<p>Either way, you need to remain calm and bring up your concerns like an adult. If the response you get is not the same, then you&rsquo;ve hit a red flag, and start your job search.</p>

<p>With luck, you&rsquo;ll be listened to and changes can be made. Especially regarding toil.  Toil is repetitive arduous work with almost nothing interesting about it. Often it can be automated away, or better tools provided to automate the boring parts.</p>

<p>Beyond that, culture is important and if you don&rsquo;t like it, you may have to move on.  Such is life in the 21st century.  Personally, I&rsquo;ve found its easy to fall into your own web of mis-conceptions.  Then you become paranoid and read too much into daily interactions.  You begin to believe people are conspiring against you, when really everyone is just worried about what they are doing and inadvertently ignoring each other.</p>

<p>That is why communication is important, even just non-work related banter.  Treating each other as machines who perform tasks causes most burn out I&rsquo;ve seen. When work is life, you become lonely if no one is talking to each other.</p>

<p>I think the loneliness hits hardest for people just out of college and getting into their mid to late 20s.  After college everyone goes into different directions. Friends you have seen daily, now you might not see for years.  And life changes leave you all as different people who may no longer relate.</p>

<p>That loss of community is hard to make up at work.  My advice - don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Even at the best job in the world, you are ultimately an employee and expendable.  Due to many factors, you might lose that community at any time.  Relish the time you are there, but don&rsquo;t make it the focus of your life.  Instead, focus on the community you really live in.  Do things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Join local clubs</li>
<li>Join local political groups</li>
<li>Join local charitable groups</li>
<li>Go outside</li>
</ul>

<p>Make the physical community around you better. You will meet people you live with in your day to day.  And it will stay with you from job to job.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Not a hard one: You are given an integer N. Can you find the least positive integer X made up of only 9's and 0's, such that, X is a multiple of N?
Any number consisting of just 9s and 0s is divisible by 9. I see a few ways to use that, also 9s and 0s are two unique characters, so another way would be to process numbers are strings matching those characters rather than evaluating every multiple of N until you hit one thats divisible by 9, as something can be divisible by 9 but not be only 9s and 0s.</div>

However, since I am working at the same place, it has not been enough to leave. I can say I have watched several people crash spectacularly. From watching them I&rsquo;ve got some shitty unsolicited advice for anyone who has a cushy middle class job.
First, get your personal shit in order.</div>

So of course this year I wanted to try the Three Sisters method of planting. I would plant corn, beans and squash together to maximize the output for a given area, and it would take a bit less work.
In the spirit of overdoing it, our neighbor was kind enough to use his big Kobota tractor with a tiller attachment to grind up a big area in our backyard.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Out the door Leading up to the first weekend away, we called and sent an email to the case worker. We wanted confirmation the children would be able to go to their Aunt&rsquo;s for the weekend. Instead of confirmation (which we had gotten verbally), my wife got a bit of a dressing down over the phone (or at one of their schedule visits, I can&rsquo;t remember which). Paraphrasing - the worker more or less said no one involved had the right to make those decisions except her/Cuyahoga county.</div>

In February, we were summoned for what was called a staffing meeting. This is where various parties related to the case gather together and discuss things that could be in an email.
The meeting did not really concern us, though my wife and I were both present.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Foster care sure was something On October 26th, we got a call about our first foster placement. In the month prior, we had taken a few weekend cases for respite care. Respite care is babysitting for other foster parents. Then they can take a break or take care of a few things. Leading into the proper placement, respite care went ok. It was a bit hard since the kids were so young and couldn&rsquo;t bond with us over a weekend.</div>
