      <description>Burnout and You Having worked at the same company for 5+ years, its not impossible that at some point I&amp;rsquo;ve suffered from burnout. However, since I am working at the same place, it has not been enough to leave. I can say I have watched several people crash spectacularly. From watching them I&amp;rsquo;ve got some shitty unsolicited advice for anyone who has a cushy middle class job.
First, get your personal shit in order.</description>

      <description>This timeline is weird If you&amp;rsquo;d told me 15 years ago, I would have two kids and be fostering two more, I&amp;rsquo;d have called you nuts. I&amp;rsquo;ve turned into everyone&amp;rsquo;s dad. The stampede of footsteps every morning is my alarm clock. And my day is a constant stream of the question &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;.
Expectation never meets reality, and I&amp;rsquo;m not unhappy at all. People think you can make precarious plans and follow them.</description>
