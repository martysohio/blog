      <description>In Ohio, school districts are about 50% funded via the local school district population. Additional funding comes from the state based on the number of students. It is a terrible system that was ruled unconstitutional in the 90s and really not much has changed despite the ruling. For the curious, there are innumerable better sources on why and how that is out there on the Internet.
My local district Waterloo is no exception.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing around with PyGame and its certainly a trip. Game logic is much easier than the mechanics of drawing something in the proper order and the proper way. It took way longer than I expected to get a basic version of Pong functional.</description>

      <description>This timeline is weird If you&amp;rsquo;d told me 15 years ago, I would have two kids and be fostering two more, I&amp;rsquo;d have called you nuts. I&amp;rsquo;ve turned into everyone&amp;rsquo;s dad. The stampede of footsteps every morning is my alarm clock. And my day is a constant stream of the question &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;.
Expectation never meets reality, and I&amp;rsquo;m not unhappy at all. People think you can make precarious plans and follow them.</description>
