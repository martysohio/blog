      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing around with PyGame and its certainly a trip. Game logic is much easier than the mechanics of drawing something in the proper order and the proper way. It took way longer than I expected to get a basic version of Pong functional. Needs some final tweaks to beat the 80/20 rule and have something that is truly complete. I keep redoing it as I find something else out about PyGame and game logic in general.</description>
