      <description>When I was kid, every year around Christmas, through middle school, everyone was excited about potential gifts. For my peer group, the prized possession was any kind of gaming console and games. I.e. SNES/Gensis games, then Playstation 1/N64 up through the Dreamcast across the 90s.
Other kids had other dreams. In retrospect, those dreams were very materialistic. We all wanted things. No one was asking for experience or something intangible. Even the elementary school atmosphere encouraged materialism as a form of affection.</description>

      <description>Likely all social media sucks, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure my opinion here is not new. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a year on a Twitter account following a couple rules:
  Avoid reading popular accounts/threads. If there are thousands of people involved, its pointless noise.
  Stay local. Only follow local/state level people in Ohio. That narrows the focus.
  I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few good threads on Twitter. Otherwise, its nothing but a hot take echo chamber.</description>
