      <description>Shamelessly stole a lot of the links here from a post on SA, but thats ok, its for a good cause. Joe Biden is easily the worst Democratic party candidate for President I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my lifetime. And the farthest I can remember back is Gore (but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t vote at the time). I expect he will be another portrait on the hall of shame, for innumerable reasons, come November. Gore was the worst loss, and should have been the canary in the coal mine for the party to start shifting.</description>

      <description>If COVID-19 continues its current course in the United States, we are certainly in for a ride. Several industries are in dire straits as a result. The healthcare sector is going to collapse entirely. If its pushed over by overwhelming cases of COVID-19. For-profit and non-profit hospitals are lacking equipment, staff, and space to deal with the possibility. This site has a run down. The reality is our hospital is designed for the average load at any given time.</description>

      <description>COVID-19 is upon us, and all signs still point to the USA mirroring Italy. Due to our delay in testing and really doing anything at all, its still not really known how many cases are really out there and the rate they are spreading. However, as people are tested and what testing exists is rolled out, its clear we are experiencing exponential growth in cases throughout the country. According to the graph and data aggregated at worldometer, we&amp;rsquo;re getting 10x more cases every week.</description>
