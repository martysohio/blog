      <description>With the Democratic Presidential primary underway, there have been endless attacks on every candidate. But with Sander&amp;rsquo;s currently winning, there has been constant scare mongering about his policies and potential divisiveness. However, I believe the hype is overblown by our media. By and large, polling for the cornerstones of Sander&amp;rsquo;s platform (and to a lesser extent Warren&amp;rsquo;s) show a majority of Americans favor not only socialist policies, but also upsetting the current power structure.</description>
