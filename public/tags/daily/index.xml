      <description>Daily thoughts The weater turned out to be really good. It was predicted to be windy + gusty but that didn&amp;rsquo;t come up until the late evening. Then thunderstorm at night. The in-laws were able to come over and hang out with the boys. Plus got a lot of yard work done. The gardens are slowly getting there. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for a big push in planting by mid-May. Out of two rows of bush beans planted in early April, one is coming up.</description>

      <description>Daily thoughts Let the last few day slip by, but finally some relief from the quarantine. The in-laws isolated themselves for most of the past month. So did we. Finally they decided it was worth the risk to have us over. Other members of the family are in more risky occupations. Luckily we only work from home. So interactions outside the house have been minimal. Plus the luck of being in Portage county where COVID-19 cases are relatively low.</description>

      <description>Daily thoughts The weather is warming. On the 25th it was bright and sunny, well above 60F - 65 ? Perfect to be outside all day. And we were. Started off with our neighbors giving us a ton of horse poop (literally) that had been composting on the side of one of their pastures. It will help immensely with improving the soil on the expanded garden. Turning it over has been tedious.</description>

      <description>Daily thoughts In lieu of a journal, thought I start trying to throw short things out here. Today its freezing and lightly snowing. The last gasp of winter. After this the forecast looks like 50 degrees and higher. Of course, this weather was summoned by my attempt to plant beans early. They haven&amp;rsquo;t sprouted so they may yet live. The initial carrots got washed out. So far gardening is a failure.</description>
