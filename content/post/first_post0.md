## This timeline is weird

If you'd told me 15 years ago, I would have two kids and be fostering two more, I'd have called you nuts.  I've turned into everyone's dad.  The stampede of footsteps every morning is my alarm clock. And my day is a constant stream of the question "why".

Expectation never meets reality, and I'm not unhappy at all.  People think you can make precarious plans and follow them.  Instead you have to pick which doors to go through as they open.

Anyway, first post, lets see what else we can rant about.
