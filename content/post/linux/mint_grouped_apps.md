Simple fluff here.  Took me a while to hunt down this feature.  I switched to the latest Mint, and the applications all group by type like this -


![Mint groups](/img/groupbar.png)

If you have an Incognito tab or multiple folders, its a bit annoying for me to hover and flip through and I like to click rather than Alt+Tab or some other window switching method.

To change it:

1. Right click empty space on the taskbar, click + Add Applets to Panel

2. Select *Grouped Window List* from the next menu and click the gear icon next to it
3. In the next window untoggle the *Group windows by application* option

And thats it, now all your applications will be spread out even with multiples of the same app open.
