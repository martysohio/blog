In the search for more shows to binge, I finally got around to watching Jack Ryan.  MORE LIKE JIM RYAN, RIGHT ? But anyway, I am not sure which side the writers want the viewers to take. Like every other entry Jack Ryan media, the central character is an upstart wonk.  He sits in a corner doing his work until duty calls.  Then he is thrust back into action and becomes John Rambo as needed.

Really every time Ryan jumps into action, he escalates the situation. Its really hard to see if anything he does matters.  But fortunately in government thriller universes, being an interrupting subordinate gets you a lot of kudos.  In reality, I think Ryan would be sent to a basement for his career out of some office politics spite (dooming millions to death by terrorist).

And the ineptitude of everyone else is too real. The show tries to show the terrorists setting up elaborate schemes.  However, nothing they do is particularly clever. Just very low key.  And the intelligence apparatus in the show takes forever to find the show's equivalent to Osama bin Laden who lives in a conspicuous palace in the middle of nowhere Syria.  

The failure to locate the villain is at odds with a side story about drone pilots.  Drone pilots are depicted sitting behind computers watching drone footage in real time.  I can't say if that is realistic, though the video quality is insanely good.  In the end the mastermind's wife has to tell them where Cobra Commander's fortress is, despite the entire area apparently streaming in 1080p to the Airforce 24/7.

To conclude the season, the terrorist mastermind comes stateside and in stereotypical villain fashion, *personally* carries out the final plan.  In a roll of the dice meant to make the hero Ryan look prescient, the plan is foiled, and Ryan *personally* kills the terrorist. The ending felt rushed and contrived.  Almost too easy. Especially with the wrap up of an extrajudicial killing of the surviving unarmed co-conspirator.  

I'm not sure where the series is trying to go. The immediate post 9/11 rush of shows like 24 is played out.  Jack Ryan tries to re-kindle that with more self-righteousness.  And lacks the good cinematography of movies like the Bourne series or Baldwin's Red October.  Despite being on Amazon, the show is stuck between the quality of a prestige series and a weekly serial.
