Socialist policies, when they gain any press, are almost always large sweeping systemic changes or reforms.  True, they would be nice, but its plainly obvious the support, movement, and momentum for such change is lacking.  There are many complex reasons for that and I cannot claim to understand all of them.  But I do see a failure in building local change to create the foundation for modern socialist policies.  Let me disclose this is my take on modern socialism and what it can and should be.  

To start, socialism, communism, or whatever you want to call them, all have one thing in common.  They want to dilute power.  Especially to prevent individuals from having too much, if any, power by coercion over other people.  Creating as much consensus as possible, generally results in better outcomes.
