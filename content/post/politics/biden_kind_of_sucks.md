Shamelessly stole a lot of the links here from a post on SA, but thats ok, its for a good cause.  Joe Biden is easily the worst Democratic party candidate for President I've seen in my lifetime.  And the farthest I can remember back is Gore (but I couldn't vote at the time).   I expect he will be another portrait on the hall of shame, for innumerable reasons, come November.  Gore was the worst loss, and should have been the canary in the coal mine for the party to start shifting.  Obama took note of that in his campaign - though not in practice once in office.  Gore came out of the relative prosperity of the Clinton dampened by the impeachment and his general boring-ness.  When I look at the candidates who won after - Bush, then Obama, now Trump - I see they all have a certain *je ne sais quoi* the losers lack. 

Take Kerry, the man is about as entertaining as a bottle of ketchup.  And somehow he went from anti-war Vietnam hero to a fat cat who voted for the Iraq war. And lost. A bolder more inspiring candidate could have won.  Next we had Obama defeat McCain, another war hero turned boring dude.  Then Romney got kicked back (barely) because he , too, was too boring.  Now we have Trump because Hillary was again, boring.  Is boring-ness the only criteria we can use? No. I do think it sums up all the losing candidates flaws succinctly without diving into specifics.  Of course each race had its own nuances leading to its result. 

Trump is at least a good showman for his audience. And the man has a gift for trolling in-person and on Twitter.  [His opponents just cannot respond adequately to him](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/clinton-describes-trumped-up-trickle-down-economics/2016/09/26/5fb04e1e-8453-11e6-b57d-dd49277af02f_video.html).  That appeals greatly to the politics-as-a-sports-team base cultivated by the Republican party.

The Democrats lack this cohesion. In my view, the party is split into two groups. One might be called the *establishment*, career conservatives more interested in self-preservation than progress. They've been around the block, are competent in the rules of the game, and largely lack a long term ideological goal. The other half is pushing for more radical agendas as they can.  And though I call them halves, the reality is that conservatives rule the party. There may even be a merit to some conservative positions, but by and large conservatives put forth the most boring shit imaginable.  When your position is "nothing should fundamentally change except a few tweaks" along with one or two bones to appease radical elements you don't get much excitement. 

So along comes Biden.  Years ago, he was apparently a competent speaker.  He has a stutter, and has been known for weird gaffes. Comparing then and now, he is so much worse. I've been chided for going along with him having dementia. It wouldn't surprise me if that is the case, lets assume its not.  Since assuming the status of presumptive nominee his calls to action have been boring as hell.  His outpouring of op-eds is clearly manufactured and lacks the gravitas of Sanders.  One thing everyone can agree with on Sanders is he really believes in what he says.  Same with Trump.  I know Trump lies all the time.  However, from Trump's perspective, I don't think he is putting the effort into lie. He is so convicted he comes off sincere, in his own way.  Biden can't even meet that goal, and I simply cannot believe he has put thought into his stump speeches.

That insincerity is going to bite him now that the media is switching to attack mode. Already the Tara Reade case has gone to the main outlets. It will be downplayed by liberal media and hyped up on the other side.  Still a problem.  And that gives Trump even more ammunition.  All of this is window dressing.  Simple memes to attack and use in the media.  Soundbites for ads.  

Earlier I mentioned the two halves of the Democratic party. That is the real problem.  Biden's policy record vs his platform leaves a massive gap between what he is proposing and what he has worked towards in the past. He is linked to the wrong side of history of almost every major problem facing the working class today.  Below is a series of articles detailing Biden's disastrous support of the war on drugs, the prison industrial complex, student loans, and the Iraq War

Against Trump, Biden's record is far worse.  The body count alone is much higher only counting the Iraq War.  That puts Biden in a jam as he will have to defend his conservative policies *eventually*.  In fact, Biden's record makes Trump look like the flailing clown he is, instead of the practiced administrator of conservative death policies delivered by America's new favorite Democrat.  Its really hard to believe that Obama's legacy is going to be Trump, then Trump again. The polls waffle within a tiny margin back and forth. The 2016 experience and electoral college balance lead me to believe that small margins will give a Republican victory.

On the upside, that may be better if, and only if, Democrats take control of the Senate well past 50 votes during Trump's potential 2nd term. Making Trumps life a nightmare would be ideal. However, since so many Democrats keep confirming his judges and giving him everything he wants, the idea that Congress would make any kind of stand is liberal fantasy.  For sure if Democrats controlled the Senate, a bunch would defect to prevent a 2nd impeachment and so on.  Until I see a Democratic Party willing to fight back in solidarity the same way the GOP has, progress will not be made in any branch of government.
