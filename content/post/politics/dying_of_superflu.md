COVID-19 is upon us, and all signs still point to the USA mirroring Italy.  Due to our delay in testing and really doing anything at all, its still not really known how many cases are really out there and the rate they are spreading. However, as people are tested and what testing exists is rolled out, its clear we are experiencing exponential growth in cases throughout the country.  According to the graph and data aggregated at [worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/), we're getting 10x more cases every week.  Thats a frog boiling in water as people, [especially of the conservative](https://twitter.com/iheartmindy/status/1241156236843745280?s=19) persuasion, who simply do not understand what it takes to isolate this kind of virus.

And with its effect on the economy even BEFORE things started to get shutdown, now we'll get to see GOP governance at its finest at the federal level.  Multiple systems are going to be tested all at once and neither party wants to be the one to give in and propose what they know are the best solutions. I.E. a fuck ton of nationalization and combined effort.  I think I'll dwell on that and write a separate page about it.

Instead we get Trump saying whatever and outright lying. More obsessed with PR than action, and Pence playing interference.  And at least a few ok souls have appeared with the CDC actively doing things.  Though its likely to be too little too late.  The only countries so far to succeed totally shut everything down.  Not coincidentally, these tended to be the more authoritarian governments in Asia (China, Singapore).  Americans won't tolerate those actions.  And we might have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those meddling kids in the White House. 

More likely, by April we'll see 100k cases, and at least 1k deaths, then beyond. With most Americans unable to make ends meet even *with* a job, unless Congress acts fast they'll have a lot of bored workers on the streets and a pandemic to deal with.  Hopefully at least the TRUMPBUX will get out.  Doubtful as Democrats and Republicans will spend more time ironing out details for corporate bailouts than doing direct action to citizens and workers.  

We could have a million dead this year from this virus.  And its taking its time.  Maybe its our instant gratification consumer culture, but long term thinking about this type of problem appears to be hard for many to grasp.  The lucky middle class with savings or income less effected by economic downturns can camp out at home.  The rest will become restless and accelerate the spread, killing themselves and others.
