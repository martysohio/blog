If COVID-19 continues its current course in the United States, we are certainly in for a ride. Several industries are in dire straits as a result.  For instance, the healthcare sector is probably going to collapse entirely if its pushed over by overwhelming cases of COVID-19.  Both for-profit and non-profit hospitals are lacking equipment, staff, and space to deal with the possibility.  [This site has a run down](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/providers/covid-19-poses-long-term-impact-not-profit-hospitals).  Suffice to say, our healthcare system is designed to work at a certain capacity based on actuarial tables and such based on the common illnesses affecting our population. So any hospital system can plan for what equipment its likely to need on any given day. 

 Now hospitals have had to stop all non-essential procedures to help contain the spread.  That hurts revenues.  Logistics also tend to be just-in-time and tied to supply chains world wide. Though some companies are ramping up production on their own plus Trump's anemic Defense Production declaration, it takes time to do all that.  If severe infections ramp up too quickly, our meager system is doomed.  

 Meanwhile, the economy has decided to self-quarantine. COVID-19 really just pushed it off the cliff. If you are believer in [crisis theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_theory) this is expected. And outside that theory, we get boom and bust cycles every 8-12 years anyway since industrialization and beyond.  Restricting borders and telling everyone to stay home for at least two months turns out to be bad for business.  Now no one can really do anything but wait.  We are seeing that in policy as wherever possible government programs are being extended (unemployment) and deferred (student loans).  More or less, we're trying to pause everything for two months and come back to the economy question after the pandemic. 

 Reality is not going to let that happen.  After the 2008 recession, large portions of the population in various generations never recovered (Google X group never recovered from 2008 to learn more).  Even in 2008, people weren't doing so hot.  To tell a country where half the population can't deal with a $500 emergency spend that they need to stop working for two months is never going to work.  People can sit at home and run out of food, then they'll have to go out and get potentially exposed. 

 And with the seasons changing, natural diasters are going to come back. Increasing in intensity each year.  Especially if the summers continue to be scorching across the world, further straining all of our infrastructure.  If the US experiences another disaster at the same time with our inept leadership, the country is going to fall apart.  Already states are unable to do enough unilaterally. They depend on the Federal government for material support, not only leadership.

 Where does that leave us ? The following issues are happening now:

 * The healthcare system is collapsing , and will do faster so if Coronavirus patients surge the hospitals
 * Between the economic uncertainty manifesting in the stock market and the pause on the economy, unemployment is shooting up.  Some admins are hiding those numbers as long as they can. We can assume its already over a million filings
 * The gutting of institutional knowledge by the Trump admin combined with Trump's dipshit ideas are making expert response difficult if not impossible across all areas
 * Some states have effective governors who are taking steps, but they can't control interstate commerce.  Nor can they do things like print money to manipulate their economy in various ways
 * Wage stagnation since the 70s was already coming to a head, as Americans have no savings, are massively in debt, and job markets were not great since 2008
 * Combinations of the above world wide plus climate change create uncertainty everywhere. Ripple effects create chaos and we cannot know what else might happen i.e. the Rumsfeld doctrine *because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know.*

Prior to the application of feces to a rotating air mover, Democrats were busy with their primary and the long internal struggle between conservative Democrats (centrists and beyond) and the few progressives in power.  The larger part is known as the Green New Deal, with other initiatives like universal healthcare and raising the minimum wage.  All have a fair amount of general support across the House Democrats and absolutely can't get through the Senate. Unless the Senate swings back in November.  In short, systemic change at the state or federal level is unlikely in the short term.

But here I'm not interested in trying to predict the future. That is very difficult. I'm concerned with the future and how it has no apparent plan.  Instead, our society travels from crisis to crisis.  And throughout the world many countries aren't planning for the extreme long term.  The best at this that I can tell is China with their continuous [five year plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_China#Thirteenth_Plan_(2016%E2%80%932020)).  China is its own can of worms and I'm not going to delve into it.  But I think we can agree that China has its shit together in a lot of ways when it comes to accomplishing goals. Regardless of the implications , moral and otherwise, of its means of achieving those goals and the goals themselves.

As the richest and arguably most powerful country on Earth in terms of raw wealth and military power, we can do whatever we want. It is clear a new system is needed.  Many argue that capitalism raised people out of poverty. To an extent it did. Technological progress did that more than anything. New types of labor were needed as mass production eliminated the need for lower tiers of work.  Laborers *had* to be better educated and supplied to work the new jobs.  If capitalism itself was enough, we'd have seen the rising tide lift all ships way back in the 1700s.  

Now again, we see productivity has [increased dramatically](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/) since the 1970s and diverged from wages.  If wages aren't matching productivity, its a sign of technological progress AND pilfering of the working class by capital owners.  Some 50 years later, we're reaping the results.
