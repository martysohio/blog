With the Democratic Presidential primary underway, there have been endless attacks on every candidate.  But with Sander's currently winning, there has been constant scare mongering about his policies and potential divisiveness.  However, I believe the hype is overblown by our media.  By and large, polling for the cornerstones of Sander's platform (and to a lesser extent Warren's) show a majority of Americans favor not only socialist policies, but also upsetting the current power structure.

On the Democratic or liberal side, there is a fear that Sander's is declaring war on the Democratic establishment.  And that this war will lead to a schism and then cause a failure in turnout or support for the general election.  Again, I think a schism occurring is purely media propaganda. The war is real. Though first what is the Democratic establishment?

In my view, the establishment is the traditional power base within the party.  Think of well known people like Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton.  I would say this is mostly centrist or Third Way type Democrats leftover from the Clinton and Obama years. These are career politicians and their entourage of staff and consultants.  While claiming to support left-leaning policy, in practice they continuously fold to conservative pressure to appear as compromisers and get nothing in return. Not even Republican votes in the case of the ACA (Obamacare) !

So when progressives and campaigns like Sanders want to go up against them, its because they see this establishment as a bunch of do-nothings.  They benefit from the status-quo and aren't going to go out of their way to change it. In a sense they don't do much. They do throw bones out in the form of piecemeal reforms.  See this [Vox article](https://www.vox.com/2019/11/29/20977735/how-many-bills-passed-house-democrats-trump).  The list of bills being ignored by the Senate is long.  And what they want to achieve isn't bad.  But its a reform.  And reforms don't go far enough.  Reforms assume the underlying system isn't flawed, and subtle changes can fix it. I concede they can in some instances. But reforms are easily undone as shown by the slow death of the New Deal since FDR's death.

Therefore, Sander's supports want more.  We know the promises will be hard to realize.  We know the House, the Senate, other parts of the government willl still be awash in do-nothings.  We aren't stupid.  It is still VERY important to try rather than not.  And we'll keep pushing forward. Made easier when new additions to Congress, now insiders, [can put the pressure on](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-wants-some-company-in-congress.html).  

Putting Sander's in the Whitehouse won't make the entire platform a reality overnight. It will show the incumbents what the people want.  And an honest person who is appears to be uncorruptable will bring a cultural change that will last a lifetime given enough appointments.  Career bureaucrats and politicians may be pragmatic and go along with the ride.  Conservative Dems did this with the New Deal. If they can hold their nose, so can modern moderate Dems. Those that don't we can try to primary away on the Democratic side, or remove if they are GOP held.

Most importantly, don't give in to media fears about Sanders.  For-profit media will always be biased towards the status quo. And mixed with today's 24/7 reality TV, constant editorial poinion, they don't know what to do.  On the one-hand, the media loves broadcasting controvery, essentially hoping for trainwrecks like the 2016 Republican primary and Trump's subsquent. I don't think that same effect extends directly to voters.  

In short, its time to try something new. We tried the moderate approach for decades now, and systemtic change hasn't happened. Solving problems requires new ideas, and bold action. As well as simply TRYING something you haven't tried before.  Things will fail, but thats better than doing the same old thing and hoping for a better outcome.  And consistently, whenever socialist core values are explained using terminology not burdened by Red Scare propaganda, people tend to like it!
