## Out the door

Leading up to the first weekend away, we called and sent an email to the case worker.  We wanted confirmation the children would be able to go to their Aunt's for the weekend.  Instead of confirmation (which we had gotten verbally), my wife got a bit of a dressing down over the phone (or at one of their schedule visits, I can't remember which). Paraphrasing - the worker more or less said no one involved had the right to make those decisions except her/Cuyahoga county.

That is fine and all, but her communication was routinely horrible and vague.  And despite her protest, we still didn't get a yes or no answer !

At some point, I jumped into the email chain, and sent a not very nice email to the supervisor of the case worker, and included the case worker and our contact at Caring For Kids on the email.  It detailed her perpetual non-existence and poor communication.  And I re-iterated that all we wanted was clear and written communication about what needed to happen.

No one appreciated this, and that spurred the caseworker to call us, reaching my wife, first.  During that conversation she revealed the boys would be moved permanently to their Aunt's custody on March 8th and we'd be having some kind of meeting to affirm this and transfer them. All the new information was shocking.  We had always discussed a longer transfer with a few overnight visits then full switch to make it easier for them to transition.  


Apparently potential damage to the children no longer mattered.  I sent a follow-up email asking for written confirmation about the meeting and other details that would be discussed.  I never got it, but the Social Service Supervisor did call me and we had a brief argument.  She claimed she was not aware of the case worker's frequent abscence.  I told her she was now, she could do something about it.  Obviously, I did not make any friends this way.

Following the call, we never got details on the upcoming meeting other than the time and location.  We talked with our contact at Caring For Kids who went through their grapevine. Between them and our own assumptions, we presumed the kids would be moved that day and packed accordingly.  We also prepped them by telling them what was coming up for them etc.

### Staffing or transition meeting

The final meeting was very similar to the first staffing meeting we attended. Everyone was there. The children's parents, their Aunt, relevant case workers and so on. The previous emails and other communication issues were not addressed at all. Rather the focus was on whether everyone was ready to move the children and if that would work.  One pre-req for this was a case worker visiting the Aunt's home to verify the bedding and overall living situation.  The case worker had been missing that for *months* and now had to rush it through the door.

So the final visit was worked around, and we did notice that the case worker in question was being completely ignored throughout the meeting.  She was asked a few questions, and despite the large binder in her lap, it was clear she had barely met the children.  And knew very little about the case.  Quite a shame since the case was very straightforward without a lot of complexity with respect to the children's needs.  

We did not say much. Remember foster parent opinions do not really count, here. In the end, we all agreed it was best for the kids to go with the Aunt.  So we wrapped up the meeting, said a brief goodbye to the kids (who didn't get it). Then they were taken off for a doctor's visit which is required on each transfer of placement.

After that, we moved all the stuff we could into the parent's and Aunt's van, and home we went, minus two.  

### Post foster

The following weeks were the quietest time in our house since October of last year.  Even going to Wal-Mart with two kids was a peaceful experience.  Only one person was screaming at a time, and the whole pack was manageable instead of scattering in every direction.  

The kids leaving was both difficult and not difficult. The stress of having 4 toddlers was overwhelming us and we needed a break. But we still wanted the best for them.  As time went on it was harder to reconcile those two feelings.  Leaving earlier than expected was for the best in retrospect.  And I can say overall it was a good experience with the children.  

The foster system itself, though, what a mess.  If workers and GALs are willing to skip out on the simplest of cases, I can't imagine the pain being endured by children with severe trauma and other needs. A shame, as the foster license training classes had many well-meaning people.  

Still a happy ending for them. A few weeks later, we did take them for a day to give the Aunt a break. They appeared to be doing great and were still a pack of crazy kids.
