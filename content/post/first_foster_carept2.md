## On the way

Despite the stress for everyone involved, we were aware our placements would be leaving us by summer, at least as of January. In February, we were summoned for what was called a *staffing* meeting.  This is where various parties related to the case gather together and discuss things that could be in an email.

The meeting did not really concern us, though my wife and I were both present.  We learned their Aunt was indeed going to be approved for kinship care. We would begin the process of transitioning them over in late March.  Our understanding was they would start with day trips, then overnight weekends, then a full move over. Even though the kids knew their Aunt/cousins well, it was deemed best to not suddenly move them.

To be honest, the set date was light at the end of the tunnel.  We'd be able to get back to two kids, and have time to think.  They'd be in a happier place with family until the case around their parents was resolved.  

However, that was not to be.  In early March, we'd realized a few things after talking with the kid's parents (unreliable narrators but still important) and their Aunt.

Turns out our experience with the assigned social worker was not unusual. From the beginning, we believed there would be a monthly visit from her and possibly the GAL (guardian ad litem). The GAL is the lawyer that represents **only** the best interests of the child(ren) separate from any family interests.

That never happened, and the single visit that did occur was when the kids were asleep and she never saw them.   And that visit was in January (I think).  Well all that not-work being done matters, because we were told these children would start ramping up visits in March.

However, we realized prior to the first scheduled overnight, we had never gotten anything in writing from Cuyahoga County social services, ever.  So we had no written confirmation we could hand these children over to some other set of adults.  You might see where that would be a problem.  Foster parents are more or less hired help, we don't have *custody* of the children or control over who can watch them. With few exceptions.

We started to make some calls and emails, and that started off quite the kerfuffle, for the exciting finale read Part 3.
