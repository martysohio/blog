# Daily thoughts

The weather is warming. On the 25th it was bright and sunny, well above 60F - 65 ? Perfect to be outside all day. And we were.  Started off with our neighbors giving us a ton of horse poop (literally) that had been composting on the side of one of their pastures. It will help immensely with improving the soil on the expanded garden.  Turning it over has been tedious.  This time of year the ground in that area is constantly wet and mucky.  And the soil drains poorly.  Hopefully reducing its clay content with the manure will help a bit. Plus we're doing lazy beds there - 4 feet wide - which should be higher up so the veggies themselves are drained even if the soil deeper underneath isn't so good. 

Sunday was all rain, though. Not torrential, just a consistent drizzle. Enough to make it cold and blustery. No one wanted to be outside at all. Matt and I did have a bit of fun driving the garden tractor back forth through the giant mudhole in the front yard.  Left from having a french drain installed to keep water out of the basement.
