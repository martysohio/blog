# Daily thoughts and garden update

In a sort of test run for market gardening, our garden is quite larger this year. Its had a rough start.  Early April had some warm days so I took a gamble and planted two rows of beans on April 3rd. One managed to come up and survived, and looks pretty pitiful.  Bush beans usually have ~60 day maturity. And here we are 60+ days in and they are only flowering.  Same for carrots, they took FOREVER to come up, and by the time they did they were also intermingled with lots of weeds/clover.  I could have flame weeded them but early carrot sprouts pretty much look like weeds and it all managed to come up simultaneously.  

Otherwise, I'm managing to keep things weed free.  And the pickling cucumbers went in today.
