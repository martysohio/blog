# Daily thoughts and garden update

In a sort of test run for market gardening, our garden is quite larger this year. Its had a rough start.  Early April had some warm days so I took a gamble and planted two rows of beans on April 3rd. One managed to come up and survived, and looks pretty pitiful.  Bush beans usually have ~60 day maturity. And here we are 60+ days in and they are only flowering.  Same for carrots, they took FOREVER to come up, and by the time they did they were also intermingled with lots of weeds/clover.  I could have flame weeded them but early carrot sprouts pretty much look like weeds and it all managed to come up simultaneously.  

Otherwise, I'm managing to keep things weed free.  And the pickling cucumbers went in today.  Last week our neighbor brought the last of his composted manure over for me. I really appreciate his help since he has a front loader Kubota (uses it all the time for their horses and other cleanup).  The dump trailer got stuck and left huge ruts everywhere, but worth it for the tons of manure that got added to the new tomato bed.  Before it was a solid clay mass soaked to the bone, now its only 80% clay mass and cleaned up nicely.

Likewise, the hillside bed is doing great, especially the bush beans in the thicker 30 inch beds.  The cabbages are doing *ok*. Unfortunately, flea beetles arrived and I didn't pay attention. I've sprayed the plants down each day with soapy water, but they need a bit more. I'm going to try fertilizing them to give them a boost. once they get big enough flea beetle damage isn't as much of a concern.
