# Daily thoughts

In lieu of a journal, thought I start trying to throw short things out here. Today its freezing and lightly snowing. The last gasp of winter. After this the forecast looks like 50 degrees and higher.  Of course, this weather was summoned by my attempt to plant beans early.  They haven't sprouted so they may yet live.  The initial carrots got washed out.  So far gardening is a failure.  And indoors my cabbage seedlings are too leggy.  They are falling over out of hubris.
