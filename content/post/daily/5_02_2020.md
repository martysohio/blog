# Daily thoughts
  
The weater turned out to be really good.  It was predicted to be windy + gusty but that didn't come up until the late evening. Then thunderstorm at night. The in-laws were able to come over and hang out with the boys.  Plus got a lot of yard work done.  The gardens are slowly getting there. I'm hoping for a big push in planting by mid-May. Out of two rows of bush beans planted in early April, one is coming up.  

The other row may yet arrive as it warms up.  Waiting to see before I give up on it.  Also, my notes didn't say which row was which. Good job there so I have two different beans and who knows what they are.  Other than they are in fact beans from a bush.
