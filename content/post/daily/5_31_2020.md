# Daily thoughts

Wow what a month.  Got my birthday out of the way, and tons of gardening. Switched over to 30 inch beds for the rest of the beans, and they will probably come out much better than the initial rows.  The single rows all look terrible.  But the corn is doing great. 

Things are starting to open up in Ohio, again. Like the activities our kids were enrolled in prior to the shutdowns.  Given the lack of really good information and fears of a second wave of COVID-19, we aren't doing anything this summer but staying home. Family vacation was cancelled.  Pretty disappointing and frustrating. Mainly I'm concerned about the toddlers, because they need social interaction. The oldest misses his friends and playdates from pre-school.  Its not the worst thing in the world, only depressing because they cannot understand it.
