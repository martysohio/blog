## Geese are a scourge

Since my wife and I are getting old, we've taken up gardening and with age comes us getting better at it.  So of course this year I wanted to try the *Three Sisters* method of planting.  I would plant corn, beans and squash together to maximize the output for a given area, and it would take a bit less work.

In the spirit of overdoing it, our neighbor was kind enough to use his big Kobota tractor with a tiller attachment to grind up a big area in our backyard.  That area was wildflowers for many years but time has defeated it and replaced the flowers with goldenrod and wild blackberries.  

Enough space was tilled for three fifty foot rows.  So I planted 100 or so corn seeds and waited.  For the three types of veggies, the corn had to come up first, then the beans and squash a few weeks later.  That way the beans grow up the corn and the squash surround everything on the ground.

The corn was planted, and about a week later shoots came up.  100+ of them looking mighty fine.  And within the same week, geese began flying into our pond. Different groups now and then. Mostly they kept to the far end. Twine was strung around the pond edges to discourage them from going anywhere else.  However, one morning, I saw a whole herd of them in the corn rows.

In crazy old man fashion I stormed outside and yelled at a bunch of fat birds.  Once they left, I saw most of the corn was gone.  While obvious now, turns out corn is a type of a grass, and geese love to eat that sweet sweet grass. A few remained, but alas several more mornings saw the beasts return.
