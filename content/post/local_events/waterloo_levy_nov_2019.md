In Ohio, school districts are about 50% funded via the local school district population. Additional funding comes from the state based on the number of students.  It is a terrible system that was ruled unconstitutional in the 90s and really not much has changed despite the ruling. For the curious, there are innumerable better sources on why and how that is out there on the Internet.

My local district [Waterloo](http://www.viking.portage.k12.oh.us/) is no exception. They have had a levy in some form on the ballot in every election the past few years.  And in their public statements announced they have cut bussing to the high school, and have let six teachers go plus not replacing three more.  I don't see how the district continues to exist and offer a consistent education without basic resources like a bus system.

Though I wish I could do more, I did try to get some more votes outside the local Waterloo Levy Committee group. I was granted access to voter information from the county party and ran a tiny SMS campaign.  I think I texted about 20% of the district after filtering for what I believed to be voters who would vote no.  But 1000 texts later, I got about 40 replies, with a quarter of them being No votes.  

Not great, but something. And come election day it lost on the income tax proposal by 118 votes.  After the loss, I dug through the past results (the local committee has better information back to the 70s).  Barring a complete turnaround in attitude or a demographic change, passing the levies will more or less be impossible going forward. In the last decade its barely passed in off-elections i.e. not November elections.  If there is a major election the turn out is much higher and much more against (4 to 1 against!)

And from brief chats with *no* voters, only one was against the levy for only finance reasons. Everyone else disliked the school administration for one reason or another.  Most felt the administration was manipulating finances. Cuts were being made to hurt students before staff.   I don't know how much truth there is to those claims.

But I imagine many districts are in a similar situation.  Demographics have changed as many areas have lost population.  In Portage county every school district has less students than it did in the early 2000s.   And left behind is an oversized school and administration, without a population directly invested in the school.  Leaving that kind of planning to local districts is a nightmare.  At the local level populations can swing wildly from generation to generation.  And with other districts already around, a smaller district like Waterloo can't expand their student population to compensate.  

Likely there is an optimal size for any school district that minimizes admin staff while maximizing the student and teacher population alongside education outcomes.  Some brief searching turns up quite a few papers on the subject.  And so far every one I've seen says that total student populations well over a thousand are better.  Waterloo has ~400 or so total for all grade levels.  I would rather see the district consolidated with another district or two to form a bigger and better school system, than allow a small student population to suffer.  Unfortunately, I do not see any major change coming any time soon for Waterloo.
