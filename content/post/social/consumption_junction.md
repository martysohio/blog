When I was kid, every year around Christmas, through middle school, everyone was excited about potential gifts.  For my peer group, the prized possession was any kind of gaming console and games. I.e. SNES/Gensis games, then Playstation 1/N64 up through the Dreamcast across the 90s.  

Other kids had other dreams. In retrospect, those dreams were very materialistic.  We all wanted things.  No one was asking for experience or something intangible.  Even the elementary school atmosphere encouraged materialism as a form of affection. Tiny gift shops came to the school to sell cheap items for the students to give to their parents several times a year.

Now the primary school district I went to was in a low income area of Ohio. Students were not coming from money.  And going to other districts, college, etc, I do not think a desire for material things is limited by class. I see that in the "temporarily embarrassed millionaires" line of thought pervading many people.

Buying things fills a similar hole to other forms of escapism. We think they may bring us happiness. And they are something we can control. They bring feelings of security. But various psychology studies show money doesn't buy happiness, so neither can material things.

Having my own kids now, and being a wizened old 34 year old, it is difficult to look back on those times and see all the waste.  Part of it is not having any spending money since adding two kids to the mix, and before there wasn't really any anyway for many reasons.  The benefit is I have learned not fill my life with random artifacts.  

Many I've thrown away, sold, or donated.  Keeping primarily books and items that serve some function.   I also get rid of anything I have not used in a year. I.e. excess building materials, scraps etc.  

Purchases are then reduced to a few things: 1) Food 2) Rent 3) Other

1 and 2 consume most of the income coming in.  In *rent* I include all recurring necessary payments like phone bills, life insurance, health insurance, debts and so on. Other is not very much beyond sudden unexpected expenses like car repairs and so on.

And in the end, I don't have the desire to buy anything. I don't *need* a better PC or laptop.  I did need newer jeans/pants and found those via thrift (nice Levi's I would buy new). I'm already fortunate enough to have more tools than I'll ever need for every day handy man activity.  So while I'm not in a position to buy the latest and greatest media setup, I am more than comfortable with what we have.
