Likely all social media sucks, and I'm sure my opinion here is not new. However, I've spent a year on a Twitter account following a couple rules:

1. Avoid reading popular accounts/threads. If there are thousands of people involved, its pointless noise.

2. Stay local. Only follow local/state level people in Ohio.  That narrows the focus.

I've had a few good threads on Twitter.  Otherwise, its nothing but a hot take echo chamber.  And I'm most annoyed with myself that I've fell into that trap more times than not. Too often, the only thing you can do is post some random thought, typically a negative, and fly away into space.

And most of the time, no one responds to anything! There is no dynamic back and forth. Only infinite threads dying in the void.  One reason for this is many Twitter accounts are next-gen RSS feeds.  The people running them are in some position where they use Twitter to make announcements and that is it.  Though I think if you are a real person using your account and not a staffer, you should try to respond to people who are talking to you in good faith.  

In the end, following various local politicians/government officials, its been too much empty noise.  Every now and then a gem appears with something interesting or helpful. The rest of the time its partisan hot takes about whoever.  The limited nature of tweets ensures you can never give a good complete response, even if someone does engage you.  

Left in the dark, I end up posting more negative than positive things. Because its extremely frustrating to try and engage a local official and hear nothing.  Or see them spreading their own mis-informed commentary.    I think I'll de-activate the account and move on, again. No one really cares, and all its doing is amplifying bitterness and loneliness.
