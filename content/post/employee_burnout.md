## Burnout and You

Having worked at the same company for 5+ years, its not impossible that at some point I've suffered from burnout.  However, since I am working at the same place, it has not been enough to leave.  I can say I have watched several people crash spectacularly.  From watching them I've got some shitty unsolicited advice for anyone who has a cushy middle class job.

First, get your personal shit in order.  Everyone has problems, sucks, but true.  It is very possible you are right, and your work sucks and everyone there is conspiring against you.  However, introspection is the best first step you can take.

Your personal shit may range from the simple, like making you are getting the right amount of sleep, diet, and exercise. To the complex, where you have various health issues (including mental health!) outside your immediate control.  Get help for any of it ! Find a workout buddy, get your significant other to join you in your quest to exercise and feel alive.  Or see a doctor (assuming you have health insurance, may not apply in America).

The point of introspection is not to shift blame away from your employer or work conditions.  Rather I think anyone should eliminate the other possibilities, first.  And you may not be able to control your work conditions so it is best to focus on what can be changed immediately, then work your way out.  Of course, some situations may be obviously untenable and clearly external.  

Assuming your personal life is going great, start looking at your work environment.  What kind of problems are exhausting you -

* Are you bored ?
* Do you feel stagnant in your current position ?
* Is someone or something contributing to a toxic work environment ?
* Is the work itself toil ?
* Are changes within the company creating uncertainty for your future ?

The general answer to concerns like the above is to talk to your management. If your direct manager is causing you a problem, there should be another above him or her you can talk to.  If that is frowned upon, leave because open door policies are important for resolving issues.  Alternatively, maybe you reached the top of the chain (CEO/owners) and then you take a risk with the discussion.  

Either way, you need to remain calm and bring up your concerns like an adult. If the response you get is not the same, then you've hit a red flag, and start your job search.  

With luck, you'll be listened to and changes can be made. Especially regarding toil.  Toil is repetitive arduous work with almost nothing interesting about it. Often it can be automated away, or better tools provided to automate the boring parts.  

Beyond that, culture is important and if you don't like it, you may have to move on.  Such is life in the 21st century.  Personally, I've found its easy to fall into your own web of mis-conceptions.  Then you become paranoid and read too much into daily interactions.  You begin to believe people are conspiring against you, when really everyone is just worried about what they are doing and inadvertently ignoring each other.

That is why communication is important, even just non-work related banter.  Treating each other as machines who perform tasks causes most burn out I've seen. When work is life, you become lonely if no one is talking to each other.   

I think the loneliness hits hardest for people just out of college and getting into their mid to late 20s.  After college everyone goes into different directions. Friends you have seen daily, now you might not see for years.  And life changes leave you all as different people who may no longer relate.

That loss of community is hard to make up at work.  My advice - don't.  

Even at the best job in the world, you are ultimately an employee and expendable.  Due to many factors, you might lose that community at any time.  Relish the time you are there, but don't make it the focus of your life.  Instead, focus on the community you really live in.  Do things like:

* Join local clubs
* Join local political groups
* Join local charitable groups
* Go outside

Make the physical community around you better. You will meet people you live with in your day to day.  And it will stay with you from job to job.
