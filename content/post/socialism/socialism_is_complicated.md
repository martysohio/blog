Socialism is a complicated topic and not the shallow term frequently employed by its critics. Since many people already put the effort in at Wikipedia, you can [read all about Socialism there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism).  Once you've read that, you should be convinced that socialism is not well defined.  

Unfortunately, the lack of definition leaves socialism open for quick attacks from anyone in any circumstance.  Rebuttals are difficult, only because most people on the attack against socialist policies tend to do so in bad faith.  Remember the best counter to a bad faith argument is not to engage. If you find yourself publicly debating someone engaging in bad faith attacks, ignore them and talk about whatever you want. 

That said, what is or isn't socialism? Let me start with what I disagree with, all the negative connations and failings in socialism's past.  I do not think socialism works in an authoritative fashion. I.e. the Soviet or eastern European-style of socialism that is really authoritarian state capitalism/kleptocracy rather than democratic government.  Without strong democratic institutions and protections to keep them in place, any government can quickly turn authoritarian. So no, I do not want the government to take over all means of production and centralize the economy.  Though there are many instances where that is a good strategy.

Instead, I'd rather see more civic participation down to the local level. Both in the government and workplaces.   And encouragement starts at home, by making sure kids are brought up knowing they MUST take an interest in their society.  Looking back, I can't think of any practical advice given in any social studies or close to civics class at all.  College courses did not elaborate.  The three branches of *federal* government were covered.  Overall, you never saw or learned about the day-to-day government you'd have to deal with. 

To this day, local township politics are a byzantine mystery to me. But it can't be that difficult. The roads exist, basic utlities, zoning, school boards work.  And a handful of people make it happen.  In an effort to learn more and live by example, I have tried
