# Daily thoughts

Let the last few day slip by, but finally some relief from the quarantine.  The in-laws isolated themselves for most of the past month. So did we. Finally they decided it was worth the risk to have us over.  Other members of the family are in more risky occupations. Luckily we only work from home.  So interactions outside the house have been minimal.  Plus the luck of being in Portage county where COVID-19 cases are relatively low.  

And still, that was a risk, especially if the rate of being asymptomatic is accurate.  But we're all pretty confident it will be ok.  And we got to spend the whole day hanging out and letting someone else play with the kids for once.  Very relaxing. Except at night the kids were terrible because they always have a hard time sleeping away from home.  Really appears there is an age gap, where as babies they can sleep anywhere, then toddlers get very picky for a while.  

The weather was really nice, too, so Luke was able to play around in the in-laws forested back yard.  And grandpa even started a fire.  Luke was a great helper throwing all the sticks he could in (with approval).
